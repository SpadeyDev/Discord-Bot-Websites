            Miki does not play around when it comes to providing utility for
            your server. Server owners can incentivize their communities by
            implementing role rewards, making roles level-based, purchasable or
            self-assignable. In addition, Miki provides a lot of moderation
            tools such as cleaning up chats and removing unwanted users from
            your server.
